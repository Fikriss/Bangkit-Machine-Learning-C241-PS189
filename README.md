# InFruit App Model

This project is for our final capstone project in **Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch 1 - Machine Learning Learning path**.

In this project, we build two machine learning models: one to detect fruit freshness and another to classify some fruits into particular quality categories. Both models use computer vision techniques. The fresh and rotten model was created using CNN architecture and the grading model was created using transfer learning. The trained model was then applied to the mobile application using TFLite.
